# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Amazon sales data using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn). Includes KPIs (revenue, orders, delivery %, cancellations, returns), sales trends, product &amp; category insights, fulfilment analysis, and regional performance. Provides business recommendations with scope for dashboards &amp; predictive models.

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Amazon Sales Data Analysis using Python (EDA)

The dataset contained real Amazon transactions with details such as order ID, date, status,
fulfilment type, sales channel, product category, quantity, amount, and shipping information.

🔎 What I did in this project:
Conducted end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Built key KPIs: total revenue, orders, delivery %, cancellation %, return %.
Explored sales trends (monthly & daily) to uncover seasonality patterns.
Performed product/category analysis → identified top categories and high-return segments.
Conducted fulfilment analysis (Amazon FBA vs Merchant) to evaluate delivery performance.
Carried out geographical analysis → top revenue-generating states & regions.
Translated findings into business recommendations for improving sales strategies, inventory management, and customer satisfaction.

💡 Why this analysis is important:
EDA isn’t just about numbers — it tells the story behind the data. In the e-commerce world, understanding cancellations, returns, fulfilment efficiency, and regional performance is critical for:
Reducing operational inefficiencies
Enhancing customer experience
Optimizing inventory allocation
Driving revenue growth

📌 Expected Outcomes:
By doing this analysis, businesses can:
✅ Identify their strongest products & regions
✅ Minimize losses from cancellations/returns
✅ Improve fulfilment efficiency
✅ Design better sales & marketing strategies

🛠️ Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
(I chose Python here instead of Power BI because it gives more control over cleaning, wrangling, and deep exploratory analysis -
and can later be integrated with predictive models. Power BI, in contrast, 
is perfect for interactive dashboards and business reporting. Both complement each other.)

🔮 Future Scope:
Develop an interactive dashboard in Power BI/Tableau for real-time exploration.
Perform customer segmentation (RFM, clustering) to target high-value customers.
Build predictive models to forecast sales or predict cancellations/returns.
Explore a recommendation system to suggest products based on purchase history.
This project gave me the opportunity to combine technical data analysis skills with business storytelling — a key aspect of being a Data Analyst.
